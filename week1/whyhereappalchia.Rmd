## The Big Bang to the Blue Ridge

- The universe began 13.8 billion years ago.

- Appalchian Mtns: Formed over billion years ago
    + among Earth's oldest mountain ranges
    + formation from the collision of ancient landmasses
    + major uplift/folding occurred during Pangea (335mya)

- Erosion & Rejuvenation: Once as tall as the Alps, eroded to plains, then uplifted again in the Cenozoic
    + Continues to be shaped by erosion, weathering, and geological forces

## Human presence in the mountains

    + This initial settlement  occurred at the end of the last Ice Age
    + Settlers were highly mobile bands of foragers, hunters, and fishers
    
- Foraging, hunting, and fishing remained the subsistence for the Native peoples of Appalachia throughout the Archaic Period (3,000 to 10,000 years ago])

    + coveted by white settlers for use as cotton plantations and gold mining
