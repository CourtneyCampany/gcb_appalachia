## The Value of Nature at Regional Scales
<hr>
<br/>

* **Understand the *unique* ecological, economic, and social benefits that a region's natural resources provide enables more effective conservation and sustainable development planning**

<br/>

* **By focusing on regional scales, we can identify:**
    1. specific ecosystem services
    2. economic dependencies
    3. cultural values that are tied to local nature

<br/>    
    
* **Leads to more tailored and impactful strategies**

## Why is Nature so Valuble in Appalachia?
<hr>

- **Rich in biodiversity with many *endemic* species**
    + endemic species = 
    
<br/>

- **Long cultural history of land connection, especially Indigenous and settler traditions**

<br/>

- **Economically tied to natural resources—forests, streams, wildlife**
    + are coal/timber industries a 'resource curse'?

<br/>

- **Appalachian streams serve as drinking water sources for millions**
    + A recent meta analysis of >3,000 Appalachain studies over 20 years could not reach clear conclusions about the state of water quality, or its impacts on health, in any of Appalachia's subregions
    

<br/>

- **Forests help filter air and mitigate respiratory issues in rural communities**
    + Clean Air Act (Federal, 1970), Smokestacks Act (State, 2002)

## Ginseng populations are a fraction of historical levels: WHY?
<hr>
**Ginseng grows in Appalachia and a region of China called Manchuria. Ginseng in thought to aid in immunity, blood sugar regulation , stress, cardiovascular health...**

<br/>

* **Is it overharvesting?**

<br/>

* **OR is it...**
    + logging
    + surface mining
    + climate change
    + deer overpopultions
    + climate change
    + housing developement
